# MailBox 📮

## The Challenge Description

Your friend told you they're gonna send you a mail. All you're given is a single image. That's it. No address, no hints, no location. Just a picture.

**Your mission:** Find the exact coordinates of where this mailbox is located.

---

## The Approach

### Part 1: Initial Reconnaissance - Extract Visual Clues

Opening the image, I immediately spotted **two critical details:**

1. **Traffic Pattern** - Cars driving on the **LEFT side of the road**
   - This narrows down to: UK, Ireland, Australia, Japan, and a handful of others
   - But combined with the mailbox style... UK region is most likely

2. **The Mailbox** - A **distinctive green mailbox embedded in a wall**
   - Not a typical standalone mailbox
   - This is a **European mail collection box** - very specific design

**Key insight:** The combination of left-side driving + European wall-mounted green mailbox is extremely specific. This isn't random.

---

### Part 2: Mailbox Color Research - Narrowing Down the Country

---

I started researching mailbox colors across European countries. Each country has their own postal service with distinct mailbox colors:

- **France:** Yellow
- **Germany:** Yellow  
- **UK:** Red
- **Ireland:** GREEN ✅

**Success!** The green mailbox is **Ireland-specific**. Irish postal service (An Post) uses distinctive green mailboxes.

---

---

**Double confirmation:**
- Left-side driving = Ireland ✅
- Green mailbox = Ireland ✅
- Wall-mounted European style = Ireland ✅

At this point, I knew: **The location is somewhere in Ireland.**

---

### Part 3: The Critical Search - Reverse Image Lookup

Now I had to find THIS specific mailbox in Ireland. Out of thousands of green mailboxes, which one?

**Strategy:** Crop the mailbox from the image and run it through **reverse Google image search**.

---

---

After scrolling through hundreds of results with various mailboxes, I found an **exact visual match** in someone's photo collection.

---

**Where?** A **Facebook group post** about Irish postal heritage:
- Link: https://web.facebook.com/groups/967516084307068/posts/1361057801619559/?_rdc=1&_rdr#

---

### Part 4: The Comments Section - The Golden Lead

The Facebook post had comments from locals discussing the mailbox. In the replies, someone asked about the exact location, and a user responded:

> **"It's on Torquay Road, Foxrock"**

That's all I needed.

---

### Part 5: Geolocation Confirmation - Google Maps & Street View

Opened Google Maps, searched **"Torquay Road, Dublin, Ireland"** and activated Street View.

Scanned the street for around **5 minutes**, looking for the distinctive green mailbox...

**FOUND IT.** 

The mailbox was visible in the Street View imagery at:

## The Key Insights

### Why This Worked

1. **Mailbox Color Research**
   - Most people wouldn't think to research postal service design standards
   - But every country's mail service has a **distinct visual identity**
   - This is one of the fastest ways to narrow down a location from a single photo

2. **Reverse Image Search Power**
   - Google's reverse image search is incredibly powerful for OSINT
   - Someone had already photographed this exact mailbox
   - One Facebook post was all it took

3. **Community Intelligence**
   - Local people discussing landmarks online are goldmines for OSINT
   - Facebook groups, Reddit threads, forums - they often contain location confirmation
   - A single comment gave away the exact street name
